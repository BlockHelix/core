# Staked Asset Economics: What Depositors Are Actually Buying

## Summary

This document provides a rigorous classification of BlockHelix vault shares as a financial instrument, walks through the NAV mechanics with concrete numerical examples, maps the depositor's risk/return profile against known instruments, analyses the lockup mechanism, models share price dynamics under stress scenarios, and compares the revenue royalty framing to the actual structures used by Franco-Nevada and Wheaton Precious Metals. Our central conclusion is that vault shares are best classified as a **revenue participation right with a floating-rate floor** -- a hybrid instrument with no clean precedent in traditional finance. This hybrid is likely a security under the Howey test and should be treated as such for compliance purposes, regardless of whether it is formally registered.

## 1. What Exactly Are Depositors Buying?

### 1.1 Elimination of Known Categories

**Not equity.** Equity confers governance rights (voting, board seats), residual claims on liquidation, and legal ownership of the entity. BlockHelix vault shares confer none of these. There is no entity to own. There is no board. There is no liquidation waterfall (only per-share NAV redemption). Shares are economically proportional but legally vacuous.

**Not debt.** Debt instruments have a fixed maturity, a stated coupon, and seniority in a capital structure. Vault shares have no maturity (perpetual), no fixed coupon (returns are variable), and no seniority (all shares are pari passu; only the operator bond is structurally senior via first-loss).

**Not insurance.** An insurance policy defines a covered event, a payout formula, and a premium schedule. The depositor pays no premium (they receive returns, not pay them). The depositor is not the insured (the client is the insured party under slashing). The depositor is closer to the insurance company's shareholder than the policyholder.

**Not a fund unit.** Mutual fund and ETF units represent proportional claims on a diversified portfolio of assets selected by a manager. A vault share represents a proportional claim on a single revenue stream from a single agent. There is no diversification, no active management, and no portfolio construction.

### 1.2 What It Is: A Revenue Participation Right

A **revenue participation right** is a contractual claim on a specified percentage of an entity's future revenue. Unlike equity, it does not confer ownership. Unlike debt, it has no fixed repayment schedule. Unlike a royalty, it is not tied to production of a physical commodity (though the analogy is close).

Specifically, a BlockHelix vault share is:

```
A fungible, SPL-token-denominated proportional claim on:
  (a) 25% of future gross x402 revenue generated by a specific AI agent
  (b) Future DeFi lending yield on deployed idle capital (architected, not yet live)
  (c) Net of slashing losses that exceed the operator's first-loss bond

The claim is:
  - Perpetual (no maturity)
  - Redeemable at NAV after lockup period
  - Subject to a dynamic TVL cap
  - Denominated in USDC
  - Tracked via ERC4626-equivalent share math on Solana
```

### 1.3 The Closest Traditional Instrument

The closest match is a **perpetual revenue royalty with a callable redemption feature**, similar to:

- **Franco-Nevada's gold royalties:** Perpetual claims on a percentage of mine production, no operational control, no maturity, redeemable only via secondary market sale (Franco-Nevada shares trade on TSX/NYSE). BlockHelix adds direct NAV-based redemption.

- **Music royalty tokens:** Platforms like Royal.io sell fractional ownership of streaming royalties. Token holders receive a proportional share of royalty income with no governance rights. The SEC has signaled these are likely securities.

- **Revenue-based financing (Clearco/Pipe):** Capital advanced in exchange for a percentage of future revenue. Unlike vault shares, RBF has a fixed repayment cap (typically 1.3-2.0x the advance). Vault shares have no cap -- returns continue as long as the agent generates revenue.

## 2. Securities Law Classification

### 2.1 The Howey Test

Under *SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.* (1946), an instrument is a security if it involves:

1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With an expectation of profits
4. Derived primarily from the efforts of others

**Prong 1 -- Investment of money:** Depositors transfer USDC to the vault. This is an investment of money.

**Prong 2 -- Common enterprise:** All depositors share proportionally in the vault's revenue and losses. This is horizontal commonality (depositors' fortunes are tied together through pooled assets and shared returns). The common enterprise prong is satisfied.

**Prong 3 -- Expectation of profits:** Depositors expect to earn returns exceeding their deposit amount (revenue share + lending yield). The pitch materials explicitly cite 14.6-20.6% APY. The expectation of profits prong is clearly satisfied.

**Prong 4 -- Efforts of others:** The agent operator configures, deploys, and maintains the AI agent. The agent itself performs the work. The depositor contributes capital but no labour. Returns depend primarily on the operator's effort in maintaining agent quality and the AI's capability. This prong is satisfied.

### 2.2 Assessment

**Vault shares almost certainly satisfy all four Howey prongs.** They should be treated as securities for planning purposes.

This is not a legal opinion, and there are potential counter-arguments:

- **Decentralisation defense:** If the protocol has no central operator and the agent runs autonomously, one could argue that profits are derived from the agent's (algorithmic) efforts, not the efforts of "others" in the human sense. This argument is untested and likely weak -- the SEC's 2025 framework emphasises that "if token buyers expect profits based primarily on the efforts of a centralised team or promoter, the token is likely a security." Source: [SEC 2025 Guidance](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/secs-2025-guidance-what-tokens-are-and-arent-securities).

- **Utility argument:** Vault shares could theoretically serve a "utility" function (e.g., as collateral in DeFi). However, the primary use case is passive income, not utility. The SEC's January 2026 statement on tokenised securities made clear that "the format in which a security is issued or the methods by which holders are recorded (e.g., onchain vs. offchain) does not affect application of the federal securities laws." Source: [SEC Statement on Tokenized Securities](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826-statement-tokenized-securities).

### 2.3 Implications

This does not mean vault shares cannot be issued. It means they should be issued under a valid exemption (e.g., Regulation D for accredited investors, Regulation A+ for public offering up to $75M, or Regulation S for non-US persons). Alternatively, the protocol could be structured to fall outside Howey -- for example, by requiring depositors to actively participate in governance (breaking Prong 4) -- but this would fundamentally change the product.

For the hackathon, this is an academic question. For production, it is a compliance requirement that must be resolved before accepting deposits from US persons.

## 3. NAV Math: Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 3.1 Definitions

```
A = vault USDC balance (total_assets from vault_usdc_account.amount)
S = share supply (from share_mint.supply)
V = virtual assets = 1,000,000 (VIRTUAL_ASSETS constant)
W = virtual shares = 1,000,000 (VIRTUAL_SHARES constant)

NAV per share = (A + V) / (S + W)
```

The virtual offsets (V and W) serve two purposes:
1. Prevent the "donation attack" where the first depositor inflates share price by donating assets to an empty vault
2. Ensure smooth pricing when the vault is new (A and S are small)

### 3.2 Concrete Example: Life of a Vault

**Step 0: Vault creation**

```
A = 0 USDC, S = 0 shares
NAV = (0 + 1,000,000) / (0 + 1,000,000) = 1.000000 USDC per share
```

Note: The virtual offsets mean there is an implied "virtual depositor" holding 1M shares backed by 1M micro-USDC ($1.00). This virtual depositor captures a negligible amount of yield -- on a $10K vault, the virtual depositor's share is 1M / (10,001M) = 0.01% of returns.

**Step 1: Operator stakes $100 bond**

The bond goes into `vault_usdc_account` but is tracked separately in `VaultState.operator_bond`. The vault's USDC balance increases, but the bond is not "owned" by share holders -- it is a segregated liability.

However, examining the actual code: the bond USDC is transferred to `vault_usdc_account` (the same account that holds depositor funds). The `operator_bond` field tracks the amount, but the USDC is commingled. This means the vault's USDC balance (A) now includes the bond, which inflates the apparent NAV.

```
After bond: A = 100,000,000 (100 USDC in micro-USDC), S = 0
NAV = (100,000,000 + 1,000,000) / (0 + 1,000,000) = 101.000000 USDC per share
```

This is a known issue. The first depositor receives shares at a NAV inflated by the operator bond. The NAV includes the bond as an asset, but the bond is slashable and not truly available for depositor redemption. The practical impact is small: on a $100 bond with $10K+ deposits, the bond is <1% of assets. But it should be disclosed.

**Step 2: Depositor Alice deposits $1,000**

```
A = 100,000,000 (pre-deposit, includes bond)
S = 0
V = 1,000,000
W = 1,000,000

shares_minted = 1,000,000,000 * (0 + 1,000,000) / (100,000,000 + 1,000,000)
              = 1,000,000,000,000,000 / 101,000,000
              = 9,900,990 shares (approximately)

Post-deposit:
  A = 1,100,000,000 (1,100 USDC: $100 bond + $1,000 deposit)
  S = 9,900,990 shares
  NAV = (1,100,000,000 + 1,000,000) / (9,900,990 + 1,000,000)
      = 1,101,000,000 / 10,900,990
      = 101.000... (NAV preserved, as expected)
```

**Step 3: Depositor Bob deposits $5,000**

```
shares_minted = 5,000,000,000 * (9,900,990 + 1,000,000) / (1,100,000,000 + 1,000,000)
              = 5,000,000,000 * 10,900,990 / 1,101,000,000
              = 49,504,950 shares

Post-deposit:
  A = 6,100,000,000 ($6,100: $100 bond + $1,000 Alice + $5,000 Bob)
  S = 59,405,940
  NAV = (6,100,000,000 + 1,000,000) / (59,405,940 + 1,000,000) = 101.000...
```

NAV is conserved. Bob's deposit does not change Alice's share value.

**Step 4: Agent completes 60 jobs at $5 each ($300 gross revenue)**

Fee split per job: 70% operator ($3.50), 5% protocol ($0.25), 25% vault ($1.25).

Vault receives: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00

```
Post-revenue:
  A = 6,100,000,000 + 75,000,000 = 6,175,000,000
  S = 59,405,940 (unchanged)
  NAV = (6,175,000,000 + 1,000,000) / (59,405,940 + 1,000,000)
      = 6,176,000,000 / 60,405,940
      = 102.242... USDC per share
```

NAV increased by $1.242 (1.23% increase from $101.00). This is one month's revenue share accrual.

**Step 5: Alice withdraws all her shares**

```
Alice holds: 9,900,990 shares
usdc_out = 9,900,990 * (6,175,000,000 + 1,000,000) / (59,405,940 + 1,000,000)
         = 9,900,990 * 102.242...
         = 1,012,238 micro-USDC = $1,012.24

Alice deposited $1,000, withdraws $1,012.24
Profit: $12.24 (1.22% in one month)
```

Post-withdrawal:

```
A = 6,175,000,000 - 1,012,238,000 = 5,162,762,000
S = 59,405,940 - 9,900,990 = 49,504,950
NAV = (5,162,762,000 + 1,000,000) / (49,504,950 + 1,000,000) = 102.242...
```

NAV preserved after withdrawal. Bob's share value is unchanged.

### 3.3 The Virtual Offset Cost

The virtual offset creates a small systematic drag. The "virtual depositor" (1M virtual shares backed by 1M virtual assets) captures a portion of revenue:

```
Virtual depositor's share of revenue = 1,000,000 / (59,405,940 + 1,000,000) = 1.65%
On $75 monthly revenue: virtual capture = $1.24
```

This $1.24/month is revenue that accrues to no real depositor -- it is the cost of the anti-inflation-attack mechanism. At $10K TVL, this represents approximately 0.15% annual drag. This is the standard ERC4626 tradeoff and is considered acceptable.

## 4. Depositor Risk/Return Profile

### 4.1 Return Components

| Component | Source | Annual Amount ($10K TVL, 60 jobs/mo) | Variability |
|:----------|:-------|:------------------------------------|:-----------|
| Revenue share | x402 client payments | ~$900 (9.0%) | High (demand-dependent) |
| Lending yield (future) | Kamino borrower interest | ~$560 (5.6%) | Low (market rate) |
| Slashing drag | Challenge resolution | ~-$8.64 (-0.09%) | Low (for good agents) |
| Virtual offset drag | Anti-inflation mechanism | ~-$15 (-0.15%) | Fixed |
| **Net expected return** | | **~$1,436 (14.36%)** | **Medium** |

### 4.2 Risk Factors

| Risk | Description | Estimated Annual Probability | Severity |
|:-----|:-----------|:----------------------------|:---------|
| Agent demand collapse | Clients stop using the agent | 10-20% | Revenue component drops to zero |
| Smart contract exploit | Bug in vault code | 1-3% | Up to 100% loss of principal |
| Slashing beyond bond | Bond exhausted, depositor capital slashed | <0.1% (for good agents) | Variable (capped by slash amount) |
| Kamino exploit (future) | Bug in Kamino lending | 1-2% | Up to 70% of deployed capital |
| Operator abandonment | Operator stops maintaining agent | 5-10% | Revenue drops; principal preserved if no slashing |
| Regulatory action | Vault shares classified as unregistered securities | Unknown | Forced shutdown or restructuring |

### 4.3 Comparison to Known Instruments

| Instrument | Annual Return | Annual Downside Risk | Liquidity | Minimum Investment |
|:-----------|:-------------|:--------------------|:----------|:-------------------|
| US Treasury bills | 4-5% | ~0% | Daily (T+1) | $100 |
| Kamino USDC lending | 5-8% | 1-3% (exploit) | Instant | $1 |
| BlockHelix vault (base) | 14-15% | 3-5% (agent + contract risk) | Epoch-locked | $1 |
| Royalty company equity (FNV) | 8-12% + appreciation | 20-30% drawdown possible | Daily (exchange) | $50 |
| VC fund LP | 15-25% | 50-100% | 10-year lockup | $250K+ |
| High-yield corporate bonds | 6-9% | 5-10% (default) | Daily (exchange) | $1K |

The BlockHelix vault occupies a unique position: returns comparable to VC but with liquidity closer to DeFi lending, minimum investment close to zero, and a risk profile between high-yield bonds and VC. The closest risk/return match is a **high-yield bond fund with additional smart contract risk**.

### 4.4 The Sharpe Ratio

```
Expected return: 14.36%
Risk-free rate: 4.5% (US Treasuries)
Volatility estimate: 8-12% (estimated from Monte Carlo, revenue variability + slashing)

Sharpe ratio = (14.36% - 4.5%) / 10% = 0.99
```

A Sharpe ratio of approximately 1.0 is strong. For comparison:
- S&P 500 long-term Sharpe: ~0.4
- Typical hedge fund: 0.5-1.0
- Kamino USDC lending: ~0.3 (low return, low risk)
- DeFi yield farming (average): 0.2-0.5

The Sharpe ratio is attractive but should be viewed with caution: the vault has zero operating history, so volatility is estimated, not measured.

---

## 5. The Lockup Mechanism

### 5.1 How It Works

The vault tracks each depositor's last deposit epoch via `DepositRecord.last_deposit_epoch`. Withdrawals are blocked until:

```
current_epoch >= last_deposit_epoch + lockup_epochs
```

Where `current_epoch = (now - created_at) / epoch_length`.

### 5.2 Economic Justification

The lockup serves three distinct purposes:

**Purpose 1: MEV front-running prevention.** Without a lockup, an attacker can monitor the mempool for `receive_revenue` transactions, deposit just before the revenue arrives, and withdraw immediately after, capturing a share of the revenue without any time commitment. The lockup forces the attacker to hold through at least one full epoch, during which the revenue share is diluted across the entire epoch rather than concentrated in a single block.

Quantified: On a $5K vault receiving $1.25 per job, a front-running attacker depositing $5K (doubling the TVL) would capture $0.625 per revenue event. With a 1-day epoch lockup, the attacker must hold for 24 hours, during which multiple revenue events may occur and the attack becomes unprofitable relative to the capital cost.

**Purpose 2: Bank-run dynamics prevention.** Without a lockup, depositors can exit at the first sign of trouble, creating a reflexive panic. A 1-epoch lockup introduces a "cooling period" that prevents impulse withdrawals while preserving the depositor's ability to exit within a reasonable timeframe.

Historical precedent: Money market funds learned this lesson in 2008 when the Reserve Primary Fund "broke the buck" and experienced a run. The SEC subsequently required money market funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates during stress periods. BlockHelix's lockup is a milder version of the same principle.

**Purpose 3: Depositor commitment signal.** A depositor willing to lock capital for at least one epoch signals genuine commitment rather than mercenary capital-seeking. This is the same principle behind Curve's veCRV lockup (up to 4 years) and Chainlink's 28-day unbonding period.

### 5.3 Optimal Lockup Length

| Lockup Duration | MEV Protection | Bank-Run Protection | Depositor Friction | Use Case |
|:---------------|:--------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:---------|
| 0 (no lockup) | None | None | Zero | Not recommended |
| 1 epoch (1 day at hackathon settings) | Adequate | Minimal | Low | MVP / hackathon |
| 1 epoch (7 days in production) | Strong | Moderate | Moderate | Production default |
| 3 epochs (21 days) | Overkill for MEV | Strong | High | Conservative vaults |
| 12 epochs (84 days) | N/A | Very strong | Very high | Institutional-grade |

The 1-epoch lockup at 1-day epoch length (current hackathon configuration) is sufficient for MEV protection but provides minimal bank-run protection. For production, a 7-day epoch length (common in DeFi staking) provides a better balance.

### 5.4 The Lockup Reset Issue

A subtlety in the current implementation: `deposit_record.last_deposit_epoch = max(deposit_record.last_deposit_epoch, current_epoch)`. This means any new deposit resets the lockup timer for ALL of the depositor's shares. A depositor who deposited $10K six months ago and adds $100 today must wait a full lockup period to withdraw any of their capital.

This is a known DeFi antipattern. The ERC4626 standard does not address per-deposit lockup granularity. More sophisticated implementations track each deposit separately or use a weighted-average lockup. For the hackathon, the current behaviour is acceptable. For production, consider per-deposit lockup tracking.

---

## 6. Share Price Dynamics Under Stress

### 6.1 High Revenue Period

```
Month 0: NAV = 1.000000, TVL = $10,000, 60 jobs/mo
Month 3: Agent goes viral, 200 jobs/mo

Monthly vault income: 200 * $5 * 25% = $250/month
Annual rate: $3,000 / $10,000 = 30% APY (revenue component only)

NAV appreciation: ~2.5% per month
After 3 months: NAV = 1.000 * 1.025^3 = 1.0769

Dynamic cap expands: higher revenue -> higher cap -> more deposits possible
New depositors enter at NAV = 1.077 (paying fair price)
Existing depositors benefit from NAV appreciation
```

Share price dynamics are well-behaved during high revenue: NAV rises smoothly, the dynamic cap expands organically, new depositors enter at fair value without diluting existing holders.

### 6.2 Slashing Event

```
Agent delivers bad work on a $5 job. Arbitrator upholds challenge.
Total slash = 2 * $5 = $10.

Bond before: $100. Bond after: $90.
Vault balance: unchanged (slash comes from bond, which is commingled in vault_usdc_account)
```

Wait -- this reveals an important subtlety. The bond USDC sits in `vault_usdc_account`. When slashing occurs, USDC is transferred FROM `vault_usdc_account` to the client, arbitrator, and protocol. The vault's USDC balance decreases by $10. But `operator_bond` also decreases by $10 (assuming bond covers the full slash).

The NAV calculation uses `vault_usdc_account.amount` as total assets:

```
Pre-slash: A = 10,100,000,000 ($10,100: $100 bond + $10,000 deposits)
Post-slash: A = 10,090,000,000 ($10,090)
Bond tracking: operator_bond = 90,000,000 ($90)

NAV_pre = (10,100,000,000 + V) / (S + W)
NAV_post = (10,090,000,000 + V) / (S + W)
```

NAV decreases by $10 / (S + W) = approximately $0.001 per share on a $10K vault. But the $10 was supposed to come from the bond, not from depositor capital.

**This is the bond commingling issue.** Because bond USDC and depositor USDC occupy the same token account, the vault's total assets (and thus NAV) decrease by the full slash amount, even though the bond is supposed to absorb it. The `operator_bond` field decreases, but this is a bookkeeping entry, not an asset segregation.

In practice, the effect is small. On a $10K vault, a $10 slash reduces NAV by 0.1%. If the operator subsequently restakes $10 of bond (calling `stake_bond`), the vault balance is restored and NAV recovers.

For production, asset segregation (separate bond token account from depositor token account) would eliminate this anomaly.

### 6.3 Mass Withdrawal

```
Initial: 5 depositors, $2,000 each = $10,000 TVL, 50,000,000 shares total
Depositor E (20% of TVL) withdraws.

usdc_out = 10,000,000 * NAV_current = $2,000 * (1 + accumulated return)
Vault balance: $8,000 + accumulated returns
Remaining shares: 40,000,000

NAV: UNCHANGED (proven algebraically in Section 3)
```

Mass withdrawals do not cause NAV dilution. The last depositor out receives the same NAV per share as the first. There is no first-mover advantage.

The only risk from mass withdrawal is operational: if the vault has deployed capital to Kamino (future), liquid USDC may be insufficient to honour large withdrawals. This is a liquidity issue, not a solvency issue.

### 6.4 Demand Collapse (Zero Revenue)

```
Month 0: NAV = 1.050, TVL = $10,000, 60 jobs/month
Month 1: Agent's model becomes obsolete. Jobs drop to 0.
Month 2: No revenue. NAV stagnant at 1.050.
Month 3: Depositors begin withdrawing. NAV still 1.050.

Without lending yield: NAV = 1.050 indefinitely (no income, no costs)
With lending yield (future): NAV appreciates at ~0.47%/month (5.6% annual)
```

Key insight: in a zero-revenue scenario, depositors do not lose principal. NAV does not decline because the vault has no outflows (no spend instruction, no recurring costs). The depositor's loss is opportunity cost (they could earn more in Kamino), not realised loss.

This is one of the system's strongest properties: **zero revenue means zero growth, not capital destruction**. The only scenario that destroys capital is slashing, which is bounded by the operator bond.

---

## 7. The Revenue Royalty Framing

### 7.1 How Actual Royalty Companies Structure Deals

**Franco-Nevada (FNV)** operates two structures:

1. **Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalties:** Franco-Nevada receives a fixed percentage (typically 1-5%) of the mine's net revenue (gross revenue minus smelting and refining costs). The royalty is perpetual, attached to the mineral property, and survives changes in mine ownership.

2. **Streaming agreements:** Franco-Nevada provides upfront capital (hundreds of millions) in exchange for the right to purchase a fixed quantity of metal at a predetermined price (well below market). For example, Franco-Nevada's stream on Lundin Mining's Candelaria mine: $648M upfront for gold and silver production at below-market delivery prices.

**Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)** focuses on streaming:

Wheaton provides $300M-$1B upfront to mine operators. In return, Wheaton receives the right to purchase a percentage of future metal production at fixed prices ($473/oz gold, $5.75/oz silver through 2029). Wheaton then sells at spot prices (~$3,300/oz gold), pocketing the difference. The margin is enormous: ~86% gross margin on gold.

Source: [Seeking Alpha: Comparative Analysis of FNV, WPM, and Royal Gold](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825128-comparative-analysis-of-franco-nevada-wheaton-precious-metals-and-royal-gold).

### 7.2 Mapping to BlockHelix

| Royalty/Stream Feature | Franco-Nevada / Wheaton | BlockHelix |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------|
| Upfront capital | $100M-$1B per deal | $100-$50K per vault |
| Revenue claim | 1-5% NSR or fixed-price purchase | 25% of x402 revenue |
| Capital provides | Development funding for mines | Trust signal + operational runway |
| Operator keeps | 95-99% of revenue | 70% of revenue |
| Transparency | Quarterly reports, site visits | Real-time on-chain (every transaction) |
| Diversification | 100-400+ assets per portfolio | 1 agent per vault (index product planned) |
| Duration | Perpetual (mine life, decades) | Perpetual in theory; agent life in practice (months to years) |
| Liquidity | Exchange-traded (daily) | NAV redemption (epoch-locked) |
| Operator alignment | Mine operator funded by royalty capital | Operator posts slashable bond |
| Downside | Mine closure (stranded capital) | Agent obsolescence (but principal preserved if no slashing) |
| Revenue predictability | Geological reserves (decades of visibility) | No equivalent (agent demand could vanish overnight) |

### 7.3 What Transfers

The core economic logic transfers cleanly:

1. **External revenue funds returns.** Franco-Nevada's income comes from gold buyers (external to FNV). BlockHelix depositor income comes from x402 clients (external to the vault). Neither is circular.

2. **Passive income, no operational control.** Franco-Nevada shareholders do not operate mines. Depositors do not operate agents. Both earn revenue from productive assets they do not control.

3. **Operator alignment through economics.** Mine operators keep 95%+ of production, incentivising them to produce. Agent operators keep 70% and post a slashable bond, incentivising quality work.

4. **Capital enables scale.** Franco-Nevada's capital funds mine expansion. BlockHelix capital funds the agent's trust ceiling (enabling larger job sizes) and provides operational runway.

### 7.4 What Breaks

1. **Revenue visibility.** Franco-Nevada's mines have geological reserve estimates providing decades of production visibility. An AI agent's demand has no equivalent forecast. Revenue could collapse in days if a better model launches or client preferences shift. This makes BlockHelix shares fundamentally higher-volatility than royalty company equity.

2. **Portfolio diversification.** Franco-Nevada holds 434 assets. A single vault holds 1 agent. The concentration risk is orders of magnitude higher. The planned Agent Index Fund addresses this, but it is not yet built.

3. **Contractual minimums.** Royalty agreements often include minimum production commitments or break-fee clauses. BlockHelix has no minimum revenue guarantee. The operator could simply stop running the agent.

4. **Asset tangibility.** Gold mines are physical assets with scrap value even if unproductive. An AI agent has zero salvage value if it stops working.

### 7.5 The Honest Framing

The Franco-Nevada analogy is **directionally correct but magnitude-wrong**. The mechanism (passive revenue claim on a productive asset) transfers. The scale, diversification, and revenue predictability do not.

The honest framing for vault shares:

> "A perpetual revenue participation right on a single AI agent, with first-loss protection from the operator bond. Comparable to a concentrated royalty on a single early-stage mine with no geological reserve data. The lending yield floor (when deployed) provides a base return regardless of agent performance. Higher risk than diversified royalty company equity, higher return, lower minimum investment."

## 8. Open Questions

### 8.1 What Happens When the Agent Dies?

There is no "sunset" mechanism. If an agent becomes obsolete (superseded by a better model, operator abandons it), the vault's revenue drops to zero. Depositors can still withdraw at NAV (which reflects accumulated earnings but no future value). There is no "net present value of future cash flows" component in NAV -- it is purely backwards-looking (cash in the vault).

This means vault shares do not price in future expectations. The share price is always book value, never enterprise value. This is simpler and more honest than equity pricing, but it means there is no "growth premium" for high-potential agents and no "decline discount" for struggling ones. All adjustment happens through deposit flows (capital entering/leaving) rather than price discovery.

### 8.2 Should There Be a Management Fee?

Royalty companies like Franco-Nevada charge no management fee (their revenue IS the royalty stream, which functions similarly to the 5% protocol fee). However, Franco-Nevada has operational expenses (staff, due diligence, legal). The protocol fee (5%) functions as a management fee. Whether 5% is appropriate depends on what the protocol provides:

- If the protocol provides arbitration, directory, analytics: 5% is reasonable
- If the protocol provides only smart contract infrastructure: 5% may be high

Compare: Yearn Finance charges a 2% management fee + 20% performance fee. BlockHelix's 5% flat fee on revenue is simpler and more transparent.

### 8.3 Tax Classification

Revenue received by vault share holders is likely ordinary income (not capital gains) because it derives from ongoing business revenue, not asset appreciation. This has significant tax implications for US depositors and should be disclosed. The NAV appreciation from revenue accrual creates a taxable event on withdrawal (or potentially on accrual, depending on jurisdiction).
